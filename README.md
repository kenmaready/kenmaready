# Ken Maready

### Corporate/Technology Attorney & Software Developer

By day, I'm a lawyer working with technology companies (primarily startups), VCs and angel investors.  By night (and weekends), I've been teaching myself to program for about five years.  I've worked mostly in the SciPy stack (plus pytorch or tensorflow) for data/deep learning and the MERN stack for building applications, but I've also done extensive coursework in Java and have spent time learning functional languages like Haskell, Racket and MS, as well as the logical programming language Prolog.  I've been studying machine learning, particularly deep learning and AI, and am very interested in applying these technologies to financial markets.

#### What I'm currently working on:
A web-based cap table and liquidation waterfall application.  The goal is to allow a company to track holders of stock, options, warrants, convertible notes, SAFEs, etc., generate cap tables, run liquidation waterfall scenarios and export all of it to excel.  It's still in very early stages at this point, so don't expect too much in the way of functionality and please forgive the rough edges, errors and clunky UI.
