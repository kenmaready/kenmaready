### Corporate/Technology Attorney & Software Developer

By day, I'm a lawyer working with technology companies (primarily startups) and investors who fund technology companies (VCs and angels).  I've been teaching myself to program for about five years.  I've worked mostly in the MERN stack and with Python, Java and SQL, but have also taken courses in functional languages like Haskell, Racket and MS, as well as the logical programming language Prolog.  I've been studying machine learning, particularly deep learning and AI and am very interested in applying these technologies to financial markets.

#### Some of the languages/technologies I work with most:

#### I'm currently working on:
A web-based capitalization table and liquidation waterfall application.  The goal is to allow a company to track holders of stock, options, warrants, convertible notes, SAFEs, etc., generate cap tables, run liquidation waterfall scenarios and export all of it to excel.
